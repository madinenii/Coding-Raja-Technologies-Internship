Description: Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.

Steps:

1. Data Collection: Obtain historical transaction data, including features like transaction amount, timestamp, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and balance the dataset if needed.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and engineer new ones that could aid in fraud detection.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patterns and anomalies in the data using graphs and statistics.

5. Model Selection: Choose classification algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.

6. Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tech Stack:

• Python

• Data manipulation libraries

• Machine learning libraries
